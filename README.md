# rocketseat-ask-me-anything
Repository for learning Rocketseat's path: "Go + React na Pr√°tica".

This project consists of an ask me anything application, that will be able to create rooms and questions that can be upvoted. These rooms can be shared and will have an unique id to be accessed.

A web socket is implemented to make the updates on each room appear in real time.
